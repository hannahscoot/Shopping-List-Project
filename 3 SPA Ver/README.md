# Shopping-List (DataDoc ver.)
Shopping List project converted into SPA.

In order to run this project, it is super simple.
- Just clone the working branch of this repository.
- Click on the index.html file and it should load up into your browser.

> This project won't display - it was created to run on a specific website within a component. For example, it makes API requests, however for this there is no API but all the queries are included to demonstrate the exact functionality. 

___At some point, I shall add the necessary controller to redirect the requests etc. so it functions as intended. As a result the instructions etc will be updated to reflect the environment setup that is required.___
